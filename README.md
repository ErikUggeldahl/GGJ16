Global Game Jam 2016 entry.

A game where you form tribes to complete a ritual faster than another tribe. The tribe to complete their ritual first wins.

Players complete the ritual by communicating with their tribe which glyph must be pressed next in the sequence, seeing only one part of the sequence themselves.

Any number of people can join a tribe, but each additional person both increases the completion rate and complicates the chain of communication.
